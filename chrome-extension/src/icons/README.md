# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Icon Requirements

1. Format: PNG with transparency
2. Color scheme: Should match the extension's theme (suggested: green #4CAF50 as primary color)
3. Design: Simple and recognizable even at small sizes
4. Background: Transparent
5. Shape: Square with rounded corners (suggested: 2px radius for 16px icon, scaled proportionally for larger sizes)

## Usage

These icons are used in various places in the Chrome extension:
- Extension toolbar icon
- Extension management page
- Chrome Web Store listing
- Extension popup
- Chrome OS shelf

## Placeholder Icons

Until the final icons are designed, you can create simple placeholder icons:
1. Create a square canvas of the required size
2. Fill with #4CAF50 (primary green color)
3. Add rounded corners
4. Add "TF" text in white in the center
5. Export as PNG with transparency
