# Tribal Farm Combined Implementation Plan

## Project Overview ✅

We are building a **browser extension** to automate interactions with a browser-based game (similar to TribalWars). The extension communicates with a **backend server via WebSocket**. The game reloads the page after each action, so the extension must be resilient to full page reloads and loss of in-memory state.

## High-Level Architecture

### 1. Browser Extension ✅

#### a. Content Script ✅
- Injected into the game page.
- Responsible for:
  - Parsing the DOM.
  - Executing UI actions (clicks, inputs).
  - Detecting validation failures, modals, and popups.
  - Sending updates to the service worker.
  - Resuming processing after reloads.

#### b. Service Worker (Persistent Background Script) ✅
- Maintains a persistent WebSocket connection with the backend.
- Routes messages to/from the content script.
- Tracks the current command and its status.
- Handles command queuing and retry/resume logic.
- Listens for reconnection from the content script after reloads.

#### c. Extension UI ✅
- Popup or sidebar for debugging, status display, or manual overrides.

### 2. Backend Server ✅

- WebSocket server managing multiple client (extension) sessions.
- Sends action commands (e.g., `attack`, `sendResources`) with unique `actionId`.
- Receives status updates (`in-progress`, `done`, `error`, `popup`, `validationFailed`).
- Maintains action queue and can react to partial completion or retries.
