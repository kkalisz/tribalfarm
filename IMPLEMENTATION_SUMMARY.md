# Tribal Farm Chrome Extension Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

I've successfully implemented Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Tribal Farm Chrome Extension as outlined in the plan. Here's a summary of what has been completed:

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Updated manifest.json with required permissions (storage, scripting, webRequest)
- Added background service worker entry point
- Implemented basic message types and interfaces in shared/types.ts
- Set up communication channels between components

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Implemented WebSocket connection management in the service worker
- Implemented command queue management
- Implemented content script communication
- Implemented DOM parsing functionality
- Implemented UI action execution (click, input, navigate, extract)
- Implemented page reload handling with state persistence

## Next Steps

The following tasks still need to be implemented:

1. Backend Implementation:
   - Client session management
   - Command dispatching
   - Status handling

2. Advanced Features:
   - Error handling and recovery
   - State management
   - Debugging and monitoring

3. Testing and Refinement:
   - Automated tests
   - Manual testing
   - Performance optimization

## How to Test

To test the current implementation:

1. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Click 'Load unpacked' and select the chrome-extension/dist_chrome directory

2. Navigate to a plemiona.pl domain to see the extension in action
   - The extension will display a status sidebar on the left
   - A log sidebar will appear on the right

3. The extension is ready to receive commands from the backend server
   - The WebSocket connection will attempt to connect to localhost:8080/ws
   - Commands will be processed and executed on the page
